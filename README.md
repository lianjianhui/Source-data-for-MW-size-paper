# Source-data-for-MW-size-paper

Here is a collection of the data presented in Lian et al. 2024 on the radial structure and size of the Milky Way galaxy. Six data files are included here, including the surface brightness profiles of the Milky Way and the sample of local galaxies with size measurements. Below is a description of the structure of each file.

mw-sbp.txt includes the today's surface brightness (bolometric luminosity) profile (SBP) of mono-age and entire populations of the Milky Way from 0 to 17 kpc with even radial interval of 1 kpc. The same radial bins apply to all of the SBP here. The surface brightness is in unit of L_sun/pc^2 in log. mw-sbp-err.txt includes the 1 sigma stochastic uncertainty of the surface brightness measurements. mw-sbp-ml-corr.txt and mw-sbp-err-ml-corr.txt delivers the surface brightness profiles and their associated uncertainties of mono-age populations that have been corrected for the mass loss because of more rapid evolution of massive stars.

mw-sbp-multiband.txt contains the SBP of the Milky Way when 'observing' in different bands, including bolometric luminosity, optical r and near-infrared H bands.

local-galaxy-comparison-sample.txt is the local star-forming disk galaxy sample selected to compare with the Milky Way. Stellar mass is in unit of log(M_sun) and r50 in kpc.
